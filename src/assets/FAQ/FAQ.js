        "No. We only operate under a license from TED. The ‘x’ in TEDx implies that we are an independently organised conference, only operating under a license from TED. The team at TEDxShivNadarUniversity is simply a group of passionate students who have come together to support the philosophy of “Ideas Worth Spreading”.

      answer:
        "TEDxShivNadarUniversity is a non-profit event that relies on the support of our partners and the selfless contributions of our volunteers. One of our goals is to deliver an event that is on par with TED and TEDx Conferences around the world. Unfortunately, the contributions of our partners cannot cover the entire cost of the event. Production, decor, food, marketing and transportation have significant costs which we need to cover. Hence we sell tickets to the event.",

If, for unavoidable circumstances, you are unable to attend the conference, then write to us at tedx.club@snu.edu.in and suggest an attendee for your ticket.",

It also includes the costs and conveniences for any attendee exclusive events. ",

    {
      question:
        "How is a TEDx conference different from any other conference (like JOSH talks or INK talks)?",
      answer:
        "A TED Talk is significantly different from a lecture or a life story. It is one’s most compelling idea, wrapped in a powerful talk of up to 18 minutes. And a great, well-formed idea isn’t just a story or a list of facts. A good idea takes certain evidence or observations and draws a larger conclusion. A TEDx conference brings people from diverse backgrounds - professional, ethnic, economic, and academic, to one platform, to discuss, inspire, and enlighten. Here we are talking not only about the speakers for the conference, but also the attendees, partners, media representatives and academicians who grace the conference. Break times are avenues for all these people to interact and build their own network. Speakers, audience members, sponsors, media partners, organizers mingle together during the refreshments and lunch break. Discussions - some impassioned, formal, some humorous and lighthearted ensue throughout the lounge area, highlighting yet another reason why TED and TEDx conferences offer an experience which is different from that of other conferences.",
